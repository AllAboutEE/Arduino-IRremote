/* Sharp and DISH support by Todd Treece ( http://unionbridge.org/design/ircommand )

The Dish send function needs to be repeated 4 times, and the Sharp function
has the necessary repeat built in because of the need to invert the signal.

Sharp protocol documentation:
http://www.sbprojects.com/knowledge/ir/sharp.htm

Here are the LIRC files that I found that seem to match the remote codes
from the oscilloscope:

Sharp LCD TV:

DISH NETWORK (echostar 301):
http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/echostar/301_501_3100_5100_58xx_59xx

For the DISH codes, only send the last for characters of the hex.
i.e. use 0x1C10 instead of 0x0000000000001C10 which is listed in the
linked LIRC file.
